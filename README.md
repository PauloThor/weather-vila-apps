## Api Key

Please note that you need an api key to access this website. You can get one by having an account at Accuweather link above and creating an app.

After getting one, you can create an .env file and put it inside, following the .env.example

Even if you do not do any oh this, there is a default key that will be used instead. However, due to limited amount of requests that can be made, you may need to have your own key in the future.

### Search Input

It's highly recommended that you do not use this input that often since the api key will expire because of the limited amount of requests that can be made.

There is a lock icon to prevent you from using it by accident. You can press the icon and unlock the input, so use this feature with caution as you may need to get another key because of that.

### City Presets

The last city that was chosen by you will be saved into your local storage, so the next time you open this application there won't be any needs for searching again. If you have not selected one before, you will get Bras√≠lia by default.

## Header and Menu

The header is purely for visual intents, so it doens't have any major features as the options might suggest.

### City Info

Do not forget to click into your city title on all cards but the first one to acess a new link with further information.
